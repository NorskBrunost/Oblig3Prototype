                <h3>One manifestation of our mission</h3>
                <p>Our company provides an app that can make outfits for you based on the clothes you already have in
                    your closet.
                    The app uses artificial intelligence to suggest different outfits to you based on the clothes you
                    have, the
                    weather,
                    the event or a dress code.</p>

                <h2>Challenges we subsequently wish to approach</h2>
                <p>According to Dzhengiz et al. (2023) the fashion industry is a major contributor to the world´s
                    climate
                    pollution and is polluting
                    almost as much as the world´s oil extraction and production. While many of us have closets full of
                    clothes, we
                    still succumb to the
                    temptation to buy new clothes. With the rise of fast fashion (which are affordable clothes produced
                    in a rapid
                    speed) many of the
                    clothes we buy are never worn until we forget them or throw them away. (World Bank, 2019 & Dzhengiz
                    et.al. 2023)
                    <br>
                    We at StyleCycle believe that if more people know how to style the clothes they
                    already own, we can be on our way to a more sustainable future.
