                    <p>Our company provides an app that can make outfits for you based on the clothes you already have

                        your closet.
                        The app uses artificial intelligence to suggest different outfits to you based on the clothes

                        have, the

                    <h1>Challenges we subsequently wish to approach</h1>
                    <p>According to Dzhengiz et al. (2023) the fashion industry is a major contributor to the world´s
                        climate
                        pollution and is polluting
                        almost as much as the world´s oil extraction and production. While many of us have closets full
                        of
                        clothes, we
                        still succumb to the
                        temptation to buy new clothes. With the rise of fast fashion (which are affordable clothes
                        produced
                        in a rapid
                        speed) many of the
                        clothes we buy are never worn until we forget them or throw them away. (World Bank, 2019 &
                        Dzhengiz
                        et.al. 2023)
                        <br>
                        We at StyleCycle believe that if more people know how to style the clothes they
                        already own, we can be on our way to a more sustainable future.
