        <h3>One manifestation of our mission</h3>
        <p>Our company provides an app that can make outfits for you based on the clothes you already have in your closet.
          The app uses artificial intelligence to suggest different outfits to you based on the clothes you have, the
          weather,
          the event or a dress code.</p>

        <h2>Challenges we subsequently wish to approach</h2>
        <p>According to Dzhengiz et al. (2023) the fashion industry is a major contributor to the world´s climate
          pollution and is polluting
          almost as much as the world´s oil extraction and production. While many of us have closets full of clothes, we
          still succumb to the
          temptation to buy new clothes. With the rise of fast fashion (which are affordable clothes produced in a rapid
          speed) many of the
          clothes we buy are never worn until we forget them or throw them away. (World Bank, 2019 & Dzhengiz et.al. 2023)
          <br>
          We at StyleCycle believe that if more people know how to style the clothes they
          already own, we can be on our way to a more sustainable future.</p>
