<h1>About App</h1>
 <p>Introducing StyleCycle, a cutting-edge mobile application designed to revolutionize 
        the way you approach your daily wardrobe choices. StyleCycle harnesses the power of 
        your smartphone's camera and advanced AI image recognition technology to simplify and enhance your 
        outfit selection process.</p>
          <p>At its core, StyleCycle is all about helping you effortlessly curate stylish and personalized outfits. 
            Here's how it works: simply point your phone's camera at your clothing pieces, and the app's AI recognition 
            system will identify each item. Once your wardrobe is cataloged, StyleCycle's AI kicks into gear, generating a
             variety of outfit combinations for you to choose from.</p>
          <p>But that's not all. What sets StyleCycle apart is its ability to tailor those outfit suggestions to your unique
                 taste. You can provide input and preferences via AI prompts, allowing you to fine-tune the looks to match your mood, 
                 the occasion, or your personal style.</p>
<p>StyleCycle also embraces the social aspect of fashion. You can share your favorite outfit combinations with other users, providing
     inspiration and receiving feedback from a like-minded community. It's a fun way to connect with fellow fashion enthusiasts and discover 
     new ideas.</p>
     <p>Beyond its convenience and social features, StyleCycle promotes a more sustainable approach to fashion. By helping you rediscover clothing 
        items that you may have overlooked or forgotten in your wardrobe, it encourages you to get more use out of your existing pieces. This not only 
        reduces the need for constant shopping but also contributes to a more eco-friendly and conscious approach to fashion consumption.</p>
