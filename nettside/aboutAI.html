              â€¢	Help people to make an outfit out of existing clothes in their wardrobe, by using a built in AI-helper. 
              -	The last assumption we tested was if it was important that the AI only recommended clothes you already own. 
                This would only give the AI to recommend their own clothes and would not look into the stock of retail providers. 
                We also saw that how they want to navigate through the AI was pretty much even. We will have to make a prototype 
                with the different kind of interactions and do another interview to settle on one interaction.
